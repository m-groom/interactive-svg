    <p>This web application contains interactive visualisations of Markov Chains and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that I have developed as part of my research on ENSO predictability and interpretabilty of machine learning forecasts of ENSO (to be published in an upcoming paper). The app takes static SVG images of the Markov Chains and DAGs and allows users to interact with them by either hovering over nodes/edges to see information such as transition probabilities, or by clicking on nodes to bring up more detailed information including an MP4 video of the spatio-temporal composite that is associated with each node. The details of the ENSO forecasting system that was used to generate these results can be found in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01412">preprint</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For more information about the development of this application, see this <a href="https://michaelgroom.net/blog.html">blog post</a> on my website.</p>
